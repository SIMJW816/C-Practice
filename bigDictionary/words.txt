A
tragic
suicide
and
accusations
of
an
underage
relationship
have
ignited
a
controversy
within
the
Asian
entertainment
industry
raising
concerns
about
the
intense
public
scrutiny
faced
by
celebrities
particularly
during
times
of
personal
crisis
The
harsh
glare
of
media
attention
and
the
often-unforgiving
nature
of
online
commentary
are
increasingly
being
questioned
as
contributing
factors
to
the
pressures
faced
by
young
stars
This
week
actor
Kim
Soo-hyun
vehemently
denied
allegations
of
a
relationship
with
the
late
actor
Kim
Sae-ron
when
she
was
a
minor

in
Seoul
while
driving
under
the
influence
Despite
offering
a
public
apology
and
reportedly
paying
compensation
to
shops
that
lost
power
because
of
the
crash
she
faced
relentless
negative
attention
Media
and
online
commentators
scrutinised
her
personal
life
YouTube
gossip
channels
accused
her
of
exaggerating
financial
difficulties
and
questioned
her
sincerity
Critics
and
her
family
say
it
contributed
to
her
declining
mental
health

Speculation
about
a
relationship
with
Kim
Sae-ron
began
last
year
when
she
posted
a
photo
of
them
together
quickly
deleted
Gold
Medalist
the
agency
co-founded
by
Kim
Soo-hyun
denied
the
relationship
according
to
South
Korean
media
Days
after
Kim
Sae-ron
death
a
YouTube
channel
known
for
its
politically
charged
content
HoverLab
alleged
that
she
and
Kim
Soo-hyun
had
been
in
a
six-year
romantic
relationship
beginning
in
2015
when
she
was
15
and
he
was
in
his
late
20s
The
channel
released
what
it
called
evidence
including
photos
videos
and
letters
Kim
Soo-hyun
has
called
them
fabricated
Kim
Sae-ron
family
had
approached
HoverLab
to
release
the
materials
calling
it
an
attempt
to
restore
Kim
Sae-ron
image
On
March
27
a
lawyer
representing
Kim
Sae-ron
family
presented
to
journalists
what
the
family
claimed
was
a
photo
of
an
undelivered
letter
written
in
2024
in
which
Kim
Sae-ron
described
Kim
Soo-hyun
as
her
and
last
love
and
referenced
a
five-to-six-year
relationship
The
letter
was
written
after
she
failed
to
reach
Kim
Soo-hyun
to
discuss
a
debt
she
owed
his
agency
according
to
the
lawyer
After
Kim
Sae-ron's
contract
ended
and
wasn't
renewed
the
agency
asked
her
to
pay
back
700
million
won
about
000
in
damages
related
to
her
drunk-driving
case
Her
family
says
the
demand
placed
severe
pressure
on
her
Kim
Soo-hyun
has
acknowledged
that
he
dated
Kim
Sae-ron
but
insisted
their
relationship
began
after
she
became
an
adult
He
called
claims
of
an
underage
relationship
false
and
damaging
is
also
not
true
that
the
deceased
made
a
tragic
choice
because
of
my
avoidance
of
her
or
because
my
agency
pressured
her
about
debt
an
emotional
Kim
told
Monday
press
conference
He
refused
to
answer
a
question
about
when
he
first
met
Kim
Sae-ron
Could
there
be
legal
consequences
Whether
any
laws
were
broken
depends
largely
on
timing
South
Korea
raised
its
age
of
sexual
consent
from
13
to
16
in
2020
Kim
Sae-ron
was
born
in
2000
and
the
family
alleges
the
relationship
began
in
2015
when
she
was
15
and
Kim
Soo-hyun
was
27
Kim
Soo-hyun
maintains
that
their
relationship
lasted
from
summer
2019
to
fall
2020
when
Kim
Sae-ron
was
a
legal
adult
Kim
Soo-hyun's
agency
has
taken
legal
action
against
the
family
of
Kim
Sae-ron
and
HoverLab
which
first
aired
the
underage
relationship
claims
for
distributing
private
photos
and
videos
of
the
actor
including
images
of
Kim
Soo-hyun
kissing
the
late
actor
Kim
agency
said
Kim
Sae-ron
had
visited
his
apartment
and
his
family
was
present
The
agency
said
they
were
not
dating
at
the
time
On
Monday
Kim
Soo-hyun's
lawyer
announced
a
civil
lawsuit
seeking
12
billion
won
approximately
15
million
in
damages
against
the
YouTube
channel
and
Kim
Sae-ron's
family
along
with
criminal
complaints
alleging
defamation
and
violation
of
privacy
laws
Kim
Soo-hyun
and
his
agency
also
sued
the
YouTube
channel
operator
for
stalking
The
family
legal
representative
and
HoverLab
both
said
on
Wednesday
that
they
plan
to
sue
Kim
Soo-hyun
and
his
agency
for
making
false
claims
about
his
relationship
with
the
late
actor
What
role
did
online
harassment
play
Kim
death
reignited
criticism
of
South
Korea
relentless
tabloid
and
digital
media
culture
Her
family
has
singled
out
videos
with
speculative
unverified
content
portraying
her
as
emotionally
unstable
and
morally
questionable
Suing
for
defamation
is
often
a
lengthy
costly
battle
for
South
Korean
celebrities
as
many
platforms
like
YouTube
are
based
overseas
Punishments
are
typically
light
with
fines
or
suspended
sentences
Other
high-profile
cases
following
negative
online
attention
have
included
the
deaths
of
K-pop
singers
